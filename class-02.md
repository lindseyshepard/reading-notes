## From the Duckett HTML book:

### Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)


**Structural markup:** the elements that you use that helps you understand what headings and or paragraphs are
**Semantic markup:** this is what give the user extra information. Example like if you have written a quote it could tell you who said it, if you used an acronym if could tell you what it stands for.
>Tags are know as markup. 

<em><strong>Beware:</strong> </em> of the strong and emphasis tags!
- HTMLelements are used to describe the structures of the page
- HTML elementscan also provide semantic information like my beware example above. Check out the code behind the scenes!

### Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)

HTML is the structure of the page but the CSS gives it the look that the designer is shooting for. You can specify the rules that the content will follow. This is where you change the background color, the margins, how you align the footer to the bottom of the page. How the page will be displayed to the end user - that will be determined here!
