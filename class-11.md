## From the Duckett HTML book:

### Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)

- elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

### Chapter 19: “Practical Information” (476-492)

- It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

> HTMLMediaElement API makes a wealth of functionality available for creating simple video and audio players

> <audio> elements have the same HTMLMediaElement functionality available to them, you could easily get this player to work for an <audio> element too

## Flash!

 > 1990s, Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animations, and later for playing audio and video in websites.
 >> 2005, a number of factors have meant that fewer websites are written in Flash or even use elements of Flash in their pages.
