## From the Duckett JS book:

### JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”


*Lets Learn about Error Handling and Debugging!*
- If you understand execution contexts (which have two
stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error
in your code.
- Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a
process of deduction.
- The console helps narrow down the area in which the
error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
- JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates
its own error object, which can tell you its line number
and gives a description of the error.
- If you know that you may get an error, you can handle
it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
- Use them to give your users helpful feedback.

Best thing I ever learned when it comes to debugging was the power of break points! Espeically in a Chrome browser. Complete game changer when you learn how to suffle through all the files and properly step into, over or what you need with the debugger.

>A debugger; to your code and if you check the conesole you will be able to see what was going on behind scenes. This is another way to debug but instead of using the browser to step through the code, you can place a debugger line in your code and do it that way :)
