# Forms and Events

### From the Duckett HTML book:

#### Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)

*Sumarry*
- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web
page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the <tr> element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a
header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,
<tbody>, and <tfoot>.

#### Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)

*Summary Boxes*
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.


### From the Duckett JS book:

#### Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)

*Summary Events*
- Events are the browser's way of indicating when
something has happened (such as when a page has
finished loading or a button has been clicked).
- Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon.
- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.
- You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.
- The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.
