This industry used to be so everyone for themselves, engineers didn't always talk to eachother but as time moves forward if you want to be successful you need to talk to people around. Don't limit yourself to your own brain but see what others are doing and you can push your boarders for learning.

If you feel good about who you work with, you will be your best work and leave fear of rejection behind.
