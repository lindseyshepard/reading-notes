## From the Duckett HTML book:

*Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)*
 Where you place images and what images you use seriously impacts the user so choose pictures wisely. Also depending on if the image is coming off the internet or if you are saving it in a file for your website, these images will be saved differently.
 in HTML use the img tag and source where the image is being pulled from.

 3 Rules for creating images
 - Save images in the right format
 - save images at the right size
 - measure images in pixels

 the alt attribute  is used to describe the content of an image


 **REMEMBER**
 you should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format

 Photographs are best saved as JPEGs, illistrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs

*Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)*

Understanding Color.
>Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green and blue *The Color Wheel*
To find the color you want, you can use a color picker

- RGB Values 
- HEX Code
- Color Names
- HUE 
- Saturation 
- Brightness

**CSS3: HSL Colors**
CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightmess values.

Right right colors will bring your web site to life

There are three ways to specify color in CSS

Color Pickers are KEY

think about contrast between text and images

CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity

CSS3 also allows you to specify colors HSL values with an optional opacity value. This is known as HSLA


*Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)*


*Typeface Terminology*
It matters.

Serif have cute little accents on the letters. sans-serif is more smooth and monospace each letter has the same width. Depending on what you are trying to get across to the reader, the text will also set the mood without them even realizing it. 
>When choosing a typeface it is important to understand that a browser will usuallyonly display it if it's installed on that user's computer

# SCale Types
## Are different sizes
### oh your words.
#### Even though this example is given to you in headers
##### you get the gist


*...and then* you have your **classic** little things you can put into text to make <en>different things<en> stand out. 
> All depends on what you are aiming for.

Attribute Selectors allow you to create rules that apple to elements that have an attribute with a specific value

To Summarize It All 
- Properties control the choice of font, size, weight and style and spacing
- There is a limited choice of fonts assumed people have
- To use a range of typefaces you need to that the rights to use them (get a license)
- Controlling the spacing between texts is a real thing. Like double spacing brought to life
- Pseudo-code classes to change the style of an element when a suer hovers over or clicks on text or when they have visited a link **nifty**
